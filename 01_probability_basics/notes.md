# 📊 Probability Basics – Day 1

## What is Probability?
Probability measures how likely an event is to occur.

Range:
0 → impossible  
1 → certain  

Example:
If you toss a fair coin,
P(Head) = 0.5  
P(Tail) = 0.5

## What is a Random Experiment?
An experiment whose result cannot be predicted exactly.

Examples:
- Tossing a coin
- Rolling a dice
- Stock market movement

---

## What is a Sample Space?
The set of all possible outcomes.

Example:
Dice → {1,2,3,4,5,6}

---

## What is a Random Variable?
A random variable assigns numbers to outcomes.

Example:
Let X = number on a dice.

X ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6}

---

## Mean (Expected Value)
The average value of a random variable.

For dice:
(1+2+3+4+5+6) / 6 = 3.5

---

## Variance
Measures how much values differ from the mean.

High variance = more spread  
Low variance = more stable  

---

## Standard Deviation
Square root of variance.  
It measures how much values typically deviate from the mean.

---

## Normal Distribution
Many real-world things follow a bell-shaped curve:
- Heights
- Marks
- Errors
- Prices

Mean = center  
Standard deviation = spread  

This is why Z-scores work.

## Why this matters for Data Science
Probability helps us:
- Handle uncertainty
- Model randomness
- Build machine learning
- Detect anomalies (Z-scores)

This is the foundation of AI and statistics.
