# 🧠 Day 5 — Statistics & Probability Practice (Mastery)

This day is focused on **applying concepts independently**.
Try solving questions before checking any solution.

---

## 🔹 Section 1 — Probability & Randomness

### Q1
Simulate rolling two dice 10,000 times.
- Calculate the probability that the sum is 7.
- Compare it with the theoretical probability.

---

### Q2
Simulate a biased coin where:
- P(Head) = 0.6
- P(Tail) = 0.4

Run 5,000 tosses and:
- Plot the proportion of heads over time
- Explain convergence behavior

---

## 🔹 Section 2 — Descriptive Statistics

### Q3
Generate a dataset with:
- Mean ≈ 50
- Standard deviation ≈ 5

Then:
- Add extreme outliers
- Compare mean vs median
- Explain which is more robust and why

---

### Q4
Create two datasets with:
- Same mean
- Different variance

Plot both and explain:
- Why mean alone is misleading

---

## 🔹 Section 3 — Correlation & Relationships

### Q5
Generate two variables:
- Strongly correlated
- Weakly correlated

Compute correlation and explain:
- Why correlation strength matters
- Why correlation ≠ causation

---

### Q6
Create a dataset where:
- X has no effect on Y
- But correlation still appears

Explain:
- How spurious correlations arise

---

## 🔹 Section 4 — Lag & Trend Analysis

### Q7
Create a time series where:
- Effect appears after 3 time steps

Tasks:
- Compute lagged correlation
- Identify which lag shows strongest relationship

---

### Q8
Create noisy time series data and:
- Apply rolling mean (window = 5)
- Apply rolling mean (window = 10)

Explain:
- Tradeoff between smoothing and responsiveness

---

## 🔹 Section 5 — Statistical Inference

### Q9
Generate a sample with mean ≈ 100.

Test:
- H₀: mean = 95
- H₁: mean ≠ 95

Report:
- t-statistic
- p-value
- conclusion

---

### Q10
Create two groups:
- Group A mean ≈ 60
- Group B mean ≈ 62

Perform:
- Two-sample t-test
- Interpret results in business terms

---

## 🔹 Section 6 — Confidence & Errors

### Q11
Generate a sample and:
- Compute 95% confidence interval
- Check if true population mean lies inside it

Repeat experiment multiple times and observe behavior.

---

### Q12
Explain with examples:
- Type I error
- Type II error

Describe real-world consequences.

---

## 🔹 Section 7 — Real-World Thinking

### Q13
You observe:
- p-value = 0.03
- Effect size is very small

Explain:
- Why statistical significance ≠ practical importance

---

### Q14
You test 20 hypotheses simultaneously.
- 1 appears significant at 0.05

Explain:
- Why this may be misleading
- What concept this relates to

---

## 🔹 Section 8 — Reflection (IMPORTANT)

### Q15
Write 5–6 lines answering:
> “How has my statistical thinking changed from Day-1 to Day-5?”

This reflection matters more than formulas.
