# 📊 Day 4 — Real-World Statistical Case Study (FINAL)

## Objective
To apply probability, statistics, and inference together
to solve a real-world decision problem.

This day combines:
- descriptive statistics
- visualization
- hypothesis testing
- interpretation

---

## Case Study
### Problem:
A company launched a **new website design** and wants to know:

> Did the new design increase average user time on the website?

This is a classic **A/B testing** and decision-making problem.

---

## Data Description
- Group A → Old design
- Group B → New design
- Metric → Time spent on website (minutes)

---

## Statistical Approach

1. Explore data using descriptive statistics
2. Visualize distributions
3. Form hypotheses
4. Perform hypothesis testing
5. Interpret results
6. Make a business decision

---

## Hypotheses

- **Null hypothesis (H₀)**:
  Mean time spent is the same for both designs

- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁)**:
  Mean time spent is different for the new design

---

## Decision Rule

- p ≤ 0.05 → statistically significant → reject H₀
- p > 0.05 → not statistically significant → fail to reject H₀

---

## Key Takeaway

Statistics is not about math alone.
It is about **making confident decisions under uncertainty**.

This process is used in:
- A/B testing
- product analytics
- business intelligence
- data science
