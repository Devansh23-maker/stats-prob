# 📊 Day 2 — Statistics Core & Applied Analysis

## Objective
To understand how statistical concepts are used to analyze real-world data,
detect patterns, relationships, and abnormal behavior.

This day focuses on **thinking statistically**, not just formulas.

---

## 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

Key concepts:
- Mean: central tendency
- Variance & Standard Deviation: spread of data
- Why averages alone are misleading

Used to:
- Understand stability vs volatility
- Detect noisy data

---

## 2️⃣ Correlation Analysis

Correlation measures **linear relationship**, not causation.

Important points:
- Range: -1 to +1
- High correlation ≠ cause
- Spurious correlations exist

Used to:
- Explore relationships between variables
- Form hypotheses, not conclusions

---

## 3️⃣ Lag Analysis (Delayed Effects)

In real systems, effects are not instant.

Lag analysis answers:
> Does variable X affect Y after some time?

Example:
- Fuel prices today → inflation after months

This is critical in:
- Economics
- Finance
- Policy analysis

---

## 4️⃣ Rolling Averages (Trend Detection)

Short-term data is noisy.

Rolling averages:
- Smooth fluctuations
- Reveal long-term trends
- Remove seasonal noise

Used to:
- Identify structural changes
- Understand direction of movement

---

## 5️⃣ Z-Score (Standardization)

Z-score measures how extreme a value is.

Formula:
Z = (value − mean) / standard deviation

Interpretation:
- Z ≈ 0 → normal
- |Z| > 2 → unusual
- |Z| > 3 → extreme / anomaly

Used for:
- Anomaly detection
- Risk analysis
- Shock identification

---

## 6️⃣ Statistical Insight (Most Important)

Statistics is not about numbers.
It is about **interpretation**.

Key learnings:
- Not all variables strongly influence outcomes
- Weak correlation is also an insight
- Context matters more than values

---

## Why This Matters for Data Science

These concepts are used in:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Business decision making
- Machine learning preprocessing

Understanding these ideas builds the foundation
for advanced analytics and modeling.
