# 📊 Statistics & Probability for Data Science

This repository documents my **structured learning journey of Statistics and Probability**, focused on **data science and analytics applications**.

Instead of only theory, this repo emphasizes:
- statistical thinking
- simulations
- interpretation of results
- real-world relevance

The goal is to build **strong analytical foundations** required for data analysis, machine learning, and economic modeling.

Each day contains:
- **notes.md** → conceptual understanding
- **experiments.ipynb** → applied simulations & analysis

---

## 📅 Day 1 — Probability Foundations

### Concepts Covered
- Random experiments
- Sample space
- Random variables
- Mean (Expected Value)
- Variance & Standard Deviation
- Normal distribution

### Experiments
- Dice roll simulation
- Coin toss simulation
- Normal distribution generation

### Key Learning
> Probability models uncertainty and randomness, which is the foundation of all statistical analysis and machine learning.

---

## 📅 Day 2 — Statistics Core & Applied Thinking

### Concepts Covered
- Descriptive statistics (mean, variance, std)
- Correlation analysis
- Lag analysis (delayed effects)
- Rolling averages (trend detection)
- Z-scores (standardization & anomalies)

### Experiments Include
- Statistical summary of simulated data
- Distribution visualization
- Correlation analysis with noise
- Lagged correlation
- Rolling trend smoothing
- Outlier detection using Z-scores

### Key Learning
> Statistics is not about formulas — it is about understanding relationships, trends, and abnormal behavior in data.

## 🧠 Why This Repository Matters

This repository demonstrates:
- how statistical concepts are **applied**, not memorized
- how analysts **reason with data**
- how uncertainty, noise, and trends are handled in real systems

These concepts are directly used in:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Economic & financial analysis
- Machine learning preprocessing

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🎯 Learning Objective

To build a **strong statistical mindset** before advancing to:
- SQL / DBMS
- Data visualization (Power BI / Tableau)
- Machine learning & AI

---

## 📌 Note on Notebooks

GitHub does not execute notebooks.
The notebooks are meant to be:
- run locally, or
- used as documented experiments showcasing logic and methodology

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Hypothesis Testing
- Confidence Intervals
- Statistical inference
- Real-world case studies

---

📌 *This repository reflects disciplined learning and applied reasoning — not just code.*
