# 📊 Day 3 — Statistical Inference & Decision Making

## Objective
To understand how statisticians make decisions under uncertainty
using data instead of intuition.

This day focuses on:
- hypothesis testing
- statistical significance
- confidence in conclusions

---

## 1️⃣ Population vs Sample

- Population: entire group
- Sample: subset of population

We use samples because populations are often too large.

Key idea:
Good samples allow reliable conclusions.

---

## 2️⃣ Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a formal way to test assumptions.

Two hypotheses:
- Null hypothesis (H₀): nothing special is happening
- Alternative hypothesis (H₁): something is happening

Example:
H₀: Average marks = 70  
H₁: Average marks ≠ 70  

---

## 3️⃣ p-Value

p-value answers:
> If H₀ is true, how likely is this result?

Interpretation:
- p ≤ 0.05 → statistically significant
- p > 0.05 → likely due to randomness

Important:
p-value does NOT measure importance.
It measures evidence against H₀.

---

## 4️⃣ Confidence Interval

A confidence interval gives a range of plausible values.

Example:
95% CI = (68, 72)

Meaning:
If we repeated the experiment many times,
95% of intervals would contain the true value.

---

## 5️⃣ Type I & Type II Errors

- Type I error: rejecting a true H₀ (false alarm)
- Type II error: failing to reject a false H₀ (miss)

This tradeoff exists in:
- medicine
- finance
- business decisions

---

## Key Takeaway

Statistical inference helps us:
- avoid false conclusions
- quantify uncertainty
- make data-driven decisions

This is the foundation of:
- A/B testing
- experiments
- business analytics
- machine learning evaluation
