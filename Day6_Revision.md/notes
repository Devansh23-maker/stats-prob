# 📊 Probability & Statistics – Day 6 (Complete Revision)

This section covers a **quick yet complete revision** of core Probability and Statistics concepts, useful for **Data Analytics, Data Science, and interviews**.

---

## 🔹 1. Probability – Basics

### Key Terms
- **Experiment**: A random process (coin toss, dice roll)
- **Sample Space (S)**: All possible outcomes
- **Event (E)**: A subset of sample space
- **Probability Formula**  
  \[
  P(E) = \frac{\text{Favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}}
  \]

---

## 🔹 2. Types of Events

### Independent Events
- One event does not affect the other  
- Formula:  
  \[
  P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
  \]

### Dependent Events
- Outcome of one event affects the other

### Mutually Exclusive Events
- Events cannot occur together  
- Formula:  
  \[
  P(A \cap B) = 0
  \]

---

## 🔹 3. Probability Rules

### Addition Rule
\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
\]

### Complement Rule
\[
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
\]

---

## 🔹 4. Conditional Probability

Probability of A given B:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

Used heavily in **Bayes Theorem & real-world predictions**.

---

## 🔹 5. Bayes Theorem

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

### Applications:
- Spam filtering  
- Medical diagnosis  
- Machine Learning models  

---

## 🔹 6. Random Variables

### Discrete Random Variable
- Countable outcomes (dice values)

### Continuous Random Variable
- Measurable outcomes (height, weight)

---

## 🔹 7. Probability Distributions

### Discrete
- Bernoulli Distribution  
- Binomial Distribution  
- Poisson Distribution  

### Continuous
- Normal Distribution  
- Uniform Distribution  

---

## 🔹 8. Statistics – Descriptive Measures

### Central Tendency
- **Mean** – average  
- **Median** – middle value (robust to outliers)  
- **Mode** – most frequent value  

### Dispersion
- **Range**
- **Variance**
- **Standard Deviation**

---

## 🔹 9. Data Types

- **Qualitative (Categorical)**  
  - Nominal  
  - Ordinal  

- **Quantitative (Numerical)**  
  - Discrete  
  - Continuous  

---

## 🔹 10. Inferential Statistics

### Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No effect  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Some effect  

### P-value Interpretation
- **p ≤ 0.05** → Significant result  
- **p > 0.05** → Not significant  

---

## 🔹 11. Common Statistical Tests

| Test | Used When |
|----|----|
| Z-test | Large sample, known variance |
| T-test | Small sample, unknown variance |
| Chi-square | Categorical data |
| ANOVA | Compare more than 2 means |

---

## 🔹 12. Correlation & Visualization

- **Correlation** measures relationship strength  
- Values range from **-1 to +1**
- Heatmaps help visualize correlations

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Probability handles **uncertainty**
- Statistics helps in **decision making**
- Both are core foundations for **Data Analytics & AI**
